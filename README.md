Abstract
This repository contains a collection of data science projects implemented using Python. Each project demonstrates different aspects of predictive modeling and machine learning techniques:

    Movie Prediction: This project involves building a model to predict the success of movies based on various features such as genre, budget, cast, and release date. The goal is to predict box office performance, user ratings, or other relevant metrics using machine learning algorithms.

    Sales Prediction: In this project, a predictive model is developed to forecast sales based on historical data. Various features such as seasonality, promotional events, and economic indicators are considered to improve the accuracy of sales forecasts. This project demonstrates the application of time series analysis and regression techniques.

    Iris Prediction: This classic project uses the well-known Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species based on the length and width of their sepals and petals. The project explores the use of various classification algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM).

Each project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and performance evaluation. The code is well-documented and structured to provide clear insights into the machine learning process.
